# GENESIS agent coordination

**Current next-work split:** see [NEXT_IMPLEMENTATION_SPLIT.md](docs/NEXT_IMPLEMENTATION_SPLIT.md).
At the user's request, Codex is taking capability execution/evidence integration
inside the kernel boundary. Claude keeps lifecycle/recovery, Elastic and UI work;
the document lists reserved paths so both machines can proceed without overlap.

Claude currently owns the kernel and UI. Codex's capability acceptance core and
Apify execution adapter were merged in [PR #1](https://github.com/HenryWashuHe/genesis/pull/1).
Source creation/builds, the checkpointed forge and Actor runtime are merged in
[PR #2](https://github.com/HenryWashuHe/genesis/pull/2). Codex has now pushed real
capability execution and independent local acceptance in
[PR #5](https://github.com/HenryWashuHe/genesis/pull/5), branch
`codex/capability-kernel-integration`. See [the runtime/API guide](docs/CAPABILITY_EXECUTION.md).

Claude's immediate assignment is [issue #4](https://github.com/HenryWashuHe/genesis/issues/4):
fix the reproduced kernel/saga/dispatch/SSE/UI findings in PR #3, then implement
Elastic specialist provisioning/retrieval and display the new capability evidence.
Codex is now implementing the CREAO runtime on `codex/creao-runtime`; see
[the CREAO handoff](docs/CREAO_RUNTIME.md). It exposes durable pending/created/collected
progress, not a ready synchronous role. Coordinate the pending/readiness saga hook
after the PR #3 fixes. Fetch remains unassigned.
The scoped capability-route ownership above supersedes the older general API
ownership record; the whole-kernel credit fallback remains inactive.

**The user authorizes Codex to take over kernel implementation if Claude runs out
of credits.** This is a fallback, not an ownership transfer already in effect.
UI ownership remains with Claude unless separately reassigned.

See [the handoff record](docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md) for current ownership and the
information to leave at a checkpoint. Commit and push often: the agents work on
different machines, so unpushed changes are not visible to the other agent.
